<h2>Project Overview</h2>
</div>

- **Role:** Senior Product Designer
- **Company:** Newsletter2Go (Acquired by Sendinblue/Brevo)
- **Scope:** Core Product (Email, SMS, WhatsApp Editors)

As a key member of the Berlin-based Newsletter2Go team, I played a major role in developing the company's Email Marketing Editor. My work significantly contributed to the product's success, which was a key factor in the company being acquired by the French company Sendinblue. Projects I worked on, such as the Campaign pages, WhatsApp Editor, and SMS Editor, are still in use and appreciated today under the new name Brevo.

Due to limited access to the original project files and data, I am unable to provide comprehensive case studies for these early projects. However, I can discuss the key design decisions, user research methodologies, and design principles that guided my work during this period.

<h2>Email-marketing Editor</h2>
</div>

The latest version of the editor features minor updates such as slightly rounder buttons, while retaining the navigation and elements I originally designed.

During my time, I contributed to the editor across several sprints, focusing on:
- Developing the content blocks and documenting their technical functionality.
- Creating template elements.
- Designing custom icons to align with the editor's aesthetic.
- Implementing a preview function to enhance usability.
- Defining numerous variables to ensure the editor operated seamlessly.

This work laid the foundation for a robust, user-friendly email editor that continues to evolve with Brevo’s updates.

<h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
</div>

The first project I worked on when I started at the company, together with a product manager. The design remains unchanged after several years, apart from the updated logo and top-row links (Usage and Plan). I also contributed ideas and testing to encourage users to upgrade their plans, as highlighted in the bottom banner.

<h2>Sender Design</h2>
</div>

I implemented a live preview feature, shown in the second screenshot. Users can see a real-time preview on the right side, displaying how the email will appear in the recipient's inbox.

I did various rounds of user interviews which helped to develop several help text optimizations on this page and even removing some confusing elements.

I worked on several products from the company (SMS, Whatsapp, etc.) and this is just one example.
