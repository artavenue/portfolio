<h2>The Business Challenge</h2>
</div>

Ultimate was a powerful AI automation layer, but we lacked a face. We relied entirely on third-party chat providers (like Zendesk or Intercom) to host our bots. This created two critical problems:

1. **Lost Revenue:** Customers had to pay for external widget solutions.
2. **Fragmented Experience:** We couldn't control the full end-to-end user journey.

**The Goal:** Build a native, lightweight, and fully customizable chat widget from scratch to provide a simpler, all-in-one communication tool.

<h2>1. Discovery & Strategy</h2>
</div>

**Finding the "North Star"**

I facilitated stakeholder workshops to define success. We found that users didn't just want "another chat window"—they wanted speed and seamlessness.

- **User Research:** Analyzed competitor widgets and gathered customer feedback.

    <span class="image-caption">Research of different companies, analyzing their features, best practices, and opportunities for differentiation.</span>
</div>

**Strategic Slicing (MVP vs. Vision)**

Given the tight timeline, I collaborated closely with Product Management to split the roadmap. This ensured we shipped value fast while planning for scale (v1.0 MVP vs. v1.1 Scale).

    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/ultimate/version1_1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Miro Feature Mapping Table" class="project-image">
    <span class="image-caption">To prioritize features and align on the initial release, we mapped out the key components and functionalities for the chat widget. While I didn’t have access to the design files or planning materials for v1.0, this table (created collaboratively in Miro) outlines the core areas of focus for v1.1.</span>

<h2>2. The Solution</h2>
</div>

I designed a system that balances radical customization for brands with consistent usability for end-users.

**A. The "Chameleon" Design System & Rich UI**

I developed a flexible component library that allowed companies to inject their brand identity. Beyond text, I designed interactive "Cards" to enable complex transactions within the chat bubble.

    <span class="image-caption">Another example of a later feature: A customizable carousel for shopping items, hotel bookings, and various other use cases.</span>
</div>

**B. The Configuration Experience**

A widget is only as good as its setup process. I designed the admin interface to allow seamless customization.

    <span class="image-caption">The settings page for the chat widget (which followed the design patterns of ultimate).</span>
</div>

**C. Seamless Handoff & Building Trust**

The critical moment in automation is failure. I designed a seamless bot-to-human handoff passing the full history to the agent. Furthermore, addressing AI distrust was a major priority.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>

This project successfully transformed Ultimate into a standalone solution.

- ☑️ **Strategic Independence:** Reduced dependency on 3rd-party tools by 30%, mostly from new onboarding customers.
- ☑️ **Higher Engagement:** Improved usability scores and customer satisfaction due to the faster, lightweight interface.
- ☑️ **Increased Adoption:** The widget became a core product feature, making it easier for customers to adopt our platform.

**Personal Note:** This period was incredibly rewarding and marked a major milestone for the company. Shortly after, Ultimate was acquired by Zendesk, reflecting the value of the solutions we built and the team's hard work.
