<h2>Product Challenge</h2>
</div>

- Apply a user centered design approach

<h2>What did I work on?</h2>
</div>

### Structure
- Planned and created the structure (user flows, sitemap, navigation) based on the new needs of all stakeholders.
- Simplified margins for all site elements to one margin size, so content creators can use them in various orders when they create new pages.
- Simplified site elements (like Images, text fields, banners etc.) which are now easy to maintain, no more reinventing the wheel for each new page.

### Interface Design
- Collected needs for the website from different stakeholders.
- Won over a difficult stakeholder by designing detailed wireframes for every screen and state.
- Build wireframes for all pages and testing them.
- Designed all the pages, icons and the color guide.
- Created an editable styleguide.

<h2>The Old Multistep Calculator</h2>
</div>

### Before Redesign
This is how the process of generating an offer was designed before I joined the company.

**Issues to solve:**
- Distracting design.
- Lack of a clear user flow for visitors from different sources, such as ads or newsletters.
- Excessive number of tabs in the progress bar, causing users to wonder how long the process will take.
- The progress bar itself doesn't fit visually to the content - it reaches far to the right, but the clickable icons and the CTA are on the left.
- The key elements (Erdgas, Heizöl, Flüssiggas, Nachtspeicher/strom) to click have a confusing design out of 3 elements: icon, text and circle input field.
- The background image of the house on the left get's ignored by most of the people.
- The photo looks like stock photography and don't add any trustworthy value.
- Too many elements below the multistep calculator distracting the user from the main content.
- Missing a good mobile/tablet version.

<h2>Multistep Calculator — After My Redesign</h2>
</div>

### After Redesign
Some changes are done!

- Clean design.
- Same header (initially), because I wanted to test the impact of the calculator itself without influencing the conversion rate.
- Later A/B tested photos of one of Thermondo's real Heizungsbauer and new, better working copy.
- The progress navigation has only 4 points and looks as part of the whole multistep.
- The key elements which should be used by the user are now the main focus of the page and now they look more like clickable buttons.
- Elements which had no big influence on the conversation rate or shouldn't be part of the first page of the multistep at all got removed.
- Full responsive support for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

<h2>Landingpage Project</h2>
</div>

Users arrive from various sources, such as ads or directly from the homepage, often without prior knowledge of Thermondo. This first impression is crucial—you only get one chance to make it count. It’s essential to establish trust without overwhelming the user, focusing clearly on a single task.

This screenshot shows a brief version of our copy tailored for users familiar with us, which we tested against longer, more detailed versions explaining what we do and how we do it.

<h2>A/B Testing & Achievements</h2>
</div>

### 🏅 Biggest Achievement (2016)
This particular test was our biggest UX achievement in 2016! **It created 52% more leads.** 

<div class="project-image-container">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/calculator/ab-test.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="A/B Test 52% Lead Increase" class="project-image">
    <span class="image-caption">Rigorous A/B testing of copy, photography, and field reduction led to a 52% increase in lead generation.</span>
</div>

On a side note: UX Studies are showing, fewer input fields engaging more people to finish a sign up form. Because some fields are still very important, I asked for the time to call on the page after the user got his offer.

### 📈 Latest Achievement (2017)
Later, in 2017 we could improve the multistep by **19% again**. We added a new step before the last step. Now the user gets feedback about his location before he decides to share his personal data with us.
