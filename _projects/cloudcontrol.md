<h2>Project Overview</h2>
</div>

- **Role:** Senior Product Designer
- **Period:** 2009–2015
- **Scope:** Website, Pricing, Documentation, PaaS Console, Illustrations

cloudControl was a pioneer in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) from 2009 to 2015, after that it was taken over by exoscale. I worked on every part of the website like the pricing page, the Guides and the PaaS User Interface itself. I worked on HTML within the Ruby on Rails Framework, the design and all the illustrations.

In the beginning, it was hard to figure out, who was our main target group; the programmer, who wants to use our PaaS Solution, the managers who are making the decisions? So over the time, the design changed according to the audience we had in mind.

<h2>Frontpage First Design</h2>
</div>

Before we switched to the clean blue design, a lot of changes happened in the "grey" phase of the website as we explored different ways to communicate our technical value proposition.

<h2>Pricing Wizard</h2>
</div>

A complicated pricing needs an easy explanation. We found that many companies have a fixed budget for their departments. In our Pricing Wizard, customers could even calculate the costs for third-party add-ons.

<h2>The PaaS Console</h2>
</div>

I explored several different design ideas for the core application management page, balancing dense information for power users with a clean, actionable hierarchy.

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
</div>

Even in a serious B2B environment, we found room for personality and fun through custom illustrations and community-focused visuals.
