- **Role:** Senior Product Designer (Strategy, Research, UI)
- **Timeline:** 7 Days (High-Velocity Design Sprint)
- **Scope:** 0→1 MVP Concept

<h2>The Context</h2>
</div>

For enterprises running AI at scale, data isn't the problem—insight is. A typical contact center generates thousands of transcripts daily. Historically, improving an AI agent meant manually reading these logs to find failures, a slow process that created huge **"automation blind spots."**

Cognigy needed to shift from being just a tool provider to a **Strategic AI Partner**. The goal was ambitious: Move from static chatbots to **Self-Learning AI Agents** that proactively identify their own gaps and suggest improvements.

<div class="detail-section-header">
<h2>The Challenge: Speed vs. Control</h2>
</div>

The challenge was to automate the **"Insight-to-Action"** loop without removing human oversight. Enterprise clients fear "Black Box" AI making unchecked changes.

My task was to design a system that offers the speed of AI analysis with the safety of an enterprise-grade approval workflow.

**Constraint:** I had exactly one week to translate this complex product vision into a tangible, high-fidelity design concept.

### Mapping the "Closed Loop" Ecosystem

Before designing screens, I needed to architect the logic. How does a failed user conversation turn into a system improvement? I utilized **Journey Mapping** to visualize the shift from the current state ("Frustrated & Overwhelmed by Excel lists") to the future state ("Empowered by Automated Insights").

    <span class="image-caption">Mapping the logic behind the automated feedback loop.</span>
</div>

**Key Strategic Decision:** To meet the tight 7-day deadline, I focused the MVP strictly on **Internal Agent Analysis**. This offered the fastest "Time-to-Value" for existing customers without requiring complex external integrations.

<h2>2. The Solution</h2>
</div>

I designed the Analyzer not as a passive dashboard, but as an **active workflow engine**.

### A. Seeing the Invisible (Transcript Intelligence)

Instead of linear lists, the dashboard provides immediate situational awareness using AI clustering.

- **Semantic Clustering:** Visual bubbles instantly show high-volume topics (e.g., "Refunds") versus what the bot is trained to understand.
- **Friction Detection:** Automatically flagging "fallback loops" and high-frequency handovers where the AI failed.
- **Persona Identification:** Detecting user archetypes (e.g., "Frustrated User") to tailor future responses.

    <span class="image-caption">Visualizing the transition: From raw data analysis (left) to clustered insights (right).</span>
</div>

### B. The "Magic Moment": Actionable Suggestions

Insight is useless without action. I designed a **"Suggestion Engine"** that drafts the solution for the user.

- **Auto-Drafting:** The system proposes concrete fixes, such as "Create new Intent" or "Add specific FAQ," reducing the time-to-fix from hours to minutes.

    <span class="image-caption">Proactive Intelligence: The system suggests concrete fixes (e.g., "Create new Intent") instead of just showing error rates.</span>
</div>

### C. The Governance Layer (Trust)

To solve the enterprise trust dilemma, I introduced a robust **"Human-in-the-Loop" Approval Workflow**.

- **Staging Area:** Every AI suggestion enters a "Pending" state.
- **Audit Trails:** Clear tracking of who approved a change and why, ensuring no AI modification goes live without sign-off.

    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/analyzer/analyzer_approval.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Approval Workflow Detail" class="project-image">
    <span class="image-caption">Control is key: Every change requires explicit approval. The "Diff View" allows for safe review before deployment.</span>
</div>

### D. Adapting to Complexity: One Interface, Multiple Solutions

The system isn't just for text. It adapts the "Fix" interface based on the problem type, proving the design system's scalability:

- **Logic Fixes (Left):** For structural dead-ends, it visualizes the **Conversation Tree**, allowing admins to validate new branches without touching the complex flow builder.
- **Content Fixes (Right):** For knowledge gaps, it provides a **Text Diff View** (like a code review) for safe copy editing.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>

Although designed as a concept, this project redefined the product strategy.

- ☑️ **Strategic Shift:** Visualized Cognigy’s transition to a "Self-Learning" platform, moving the conversation from "building bots" to "managing intelligence".
- ☑️ **Sales Enablement:** The concept became a "Magic Moment" in sales demos. Prospects could see how uploading raw transcripts immediately resulted in a ready-to-build bot structure.
- ☑️ **High-Velocity Delivery:** Successfully translated a complex requirement set into a validated UI architecture and clickable prototype in just one week.
